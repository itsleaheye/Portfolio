# Portfolio Details
This web portfolio was developed by myself, in 2020. This website was built and designed from scratch in the SublimeText 3 IDE. 
I used web developement knowledge obtained through my formal educational experience at NAIT University (Northern Alberta Institute of Technology). All images and content within this portfolio, belong to and were created by myself (including images). This sites UI and themes were also entirely constructed by myself, and are not free to be re-used.
