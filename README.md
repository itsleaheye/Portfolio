# Portfolio Details
This web portfolio was developed by myself, in 2020. Then completely rebuilt using proper web development fundamentals, in 2021. This website was built, designed, and debugged from scratch. I used web dev knowledge obtained through my formal educational experience at NAIT University (Northern Alberta Institute of Technology).
