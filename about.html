					<p style="text-align:left">Let me introduce myself, my name is Leah, and I am a university student born and raised in Edmonton, Canada, and I am studying to become a software developer. I primarily work with object oriented programming languages, and database developement (SQL) tools. In addition to my studies I am an experienced digital artist as I manage my own freelancing career where I am both a graphic designer and an illustrator.

					<h2>Where It All Started</h2>
					<p>I have always been a logic and technology orientated individual with a very analytical mindset. Due to this, I have always excelled in technical classes such as: mathematics, physics, computer sciences, etc. I have also had several people tell me that it's ironic that I chose computer software developement as my career path given that both of my parents work in software developement as well (my mother is a systems analyst, and my father a software engineer). So there has been a long time running joke that it was my legacy to also end up a strong developer. I like to think though that the reason I am such a "tech-savy" individual is due to the fact that I have been working on my coding skills since 2013, and not just because the knowledge/skills are "in my blood." I have always had a love for technology, video games, and anything related to computers, especially learning how they were created and their functionality. This has created a passion for code developement and has become my dream to work with computers for the longterm.</p>
